    With the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, production of the Harry Potter films switched to an eighteen-month cycle, which producer David Heyman explained was "to give each [film] the time it required."[9] Chris Columbus, the director of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002), decided not to return to helm the third instalment as he wanted to spend more time with his children.[39] Even so, Columbus remained on as a producer alongside Heyman, as Columbus felt that such capacity offered him a better work-life balance, allowing him to not be present on the set all the time and spend time with his children.[40][41] Guillermo del Toro was approached to direct, but had envisioned a more Dickensian version of the stories, and was put off by the first two films which he found too "bright and happy and full of light".[42] Marc Forster turned down the film because he had made Finding Neverland (2004) and did not want to direct child actors again.[43] M. Night Shyamalan was considered to direct but turned it down because he was working on his own film, The Village (2004).[44] Warner Bros. then composed a three-name shortlist for Columbus's replacement, which consisted of Callie Khouri, Kenneth Branagh (who played Gilderoy Lockhart in Chamber of Secrets) and eventual selection Alfonso Cuarón in July 2002.[45] Cuarón was initially reluctant to direct, as he had not read any of the books or seen the films. Del Toro berated him for his arrogance and told him to read the books.[46] After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct, as he had immediately connected to the story.[47][40]

Cuarón's appointment pleased J. K. Rowling, who loved his film Y tu mamá también (2001) and was impressed with his adaptation of A Little Princess (1995).[48] Heyman found that "tonally and stylistically, [Cuarón] was the perfect fit."[9] As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Cuarón assigned Radcliffe, Grint and Watson to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Cuarón recalls, "Emma's essay was 10 pages long. Daniel's was exactly two. Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.'[49] So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.' That was the most important piece of acting work that we did on Prisoner of Azkaban, because it was very clear that everything they put in those essays was going to be the pillars they were going to hold on to for the rest of the process."[10][50]
